                This project was a small snippet of Magenta, a larger project I've been working on for quite some time now.  This particular build is meant to serve as a brief glimpse into the world, meant to set the tone.

                This project, made on weekends over a couple of months, was made as an expirement designed to figure out the best techniques for modular level design with a medieval-esque asset set.  I modelled all 3d assets and painted all textures in this scene.

                This project, was made over three weeks for a game design class, with some early help from my friend and classmate Bryat Sha, who created the menus and the level transition system.  I created all of the sprites, textures, and all but one of the sound files (the city ambiance) in this project, as well as the character movement scripts, environment effect scripts, and a couple of simple AIs that patrol.

                This project, made over two weeks as a final for an art class, was my first earnest attempt to create an asset set for a game.  In addition to the modular pipe and fence kits, I made several reusable and scalable textures for the floors and buildings, and a couple of simple scripts for navigating the scene.  Please feel free to walk around the level.
                 <br><b>Note:</b> Not all browsers support the shaders used in this project, leading to extreme shiny-ness.  Should you experience this, try playing the game on another browser (such as Firefox) or downloading it for a more accurate experience.

            <h5>Ash</h5> <p>Unity & Charcoal, 2018</p>
                </div>
            <p>
                This project was made over a week as a final project for a class.  Each of the textures was drawn first in charcoal, then scanned and used to make the materials.  The two toned nature of charcoal drawings allowed me to make excellent occlusion maps with them.  The piece was meant as an exploration of entropy, the sound and visual design meant to evoke ancientness, decay, and echoes removed from their source.
                <br><b>Note:</b> It is also recomended that you play this scene from your machine, as certain shaders in this scene aren't present in the web build.
