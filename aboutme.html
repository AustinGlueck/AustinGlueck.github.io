            <h4>Artist Statement</h4>
            <p class = "indent" style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%">     My artwork is about creating an atmosphere and sense of place. My preferred medium, or mediums, are game engines.  I find interactive explorable scenes and video games to be among the best vehicles for delivering a sense of place and atmosphere.  On top of this, the degree of agency they allow makes them excellent for creating artwork that engages the viewer directly with it's themes.  
            I make it a goal to have any narrative elements I'd like to include in a piece be as implicit as possible, the place should tell you its story in the way that it looks and sounds (and if possible, smells and feels).  The piece should evoke the themes and emotions it's meant to convey in a self contained manner, with as little extraneous exposition as possible.  Exposition can be its own immersive element (particularly the extraneous kind), but it must be presented within the work, as an unintrusive, and optionally engageable part of the whole. 
            </p>
            <p class = "indent" style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%">    I want to be able to pursue a career building this sort of artwork.  It's my passion, and I'd rather work a little harder at something I love than work less doing something I don't, just to use my free time doing the former anyways.
